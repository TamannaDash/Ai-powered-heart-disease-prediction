Welcome to the 
##AI-Powered Heart Disease Prediction project!
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on clinical data.

📋 Project Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can help in timely treatment and prevention.
This AI-powered system analyzes important medical parameters and predicts the presence of heart disease with high accuracy.

🚀 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of heart disease dataset.

Data preprocessing and feature selection.

Implementation of multiple machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

Model evaluation based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

Deployment-ready model that can be integrated with applications.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Dataset
The dataset used is the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which contains 14 attributes that are commonly used in predicting heart disease.

Attributes include:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

Serum Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Resting Electrocardiographic results (restecg)

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)

Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)

ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak)

The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)

Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)

Target (Presence or absence of heart disease)
